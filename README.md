# HybridFieldMapper

A quantum-electromagnetic AI propagation system for conductive networks, built by **AiProphet13** for the community. Powered by Qiskit, MEEP, and evolutionary algorithms. Open-source under MIT license, *FREE FOR ALL*.

## Features
- **Quantum Processing**: Optimized for IBM Quantum’s Falcon processors with SABRE transpilation and M3 mitigation.
- **EM Simulations**: MEEP-based field modeling for complex topologies (grid, star, ring, hybrid).
- **Noise Resilience**: Wavelet denoising and XY4 dynamical decoupling (33% fidelity boost under noise).
- **Statistical Analysis**: Tukey’s HSD, noise sensitivity, topology impact (72% variance explained).
- **Dashboard**: Plotly Dash with real-time metrics, 3D network visualizations, and Slack alerts.
- **Deployment**: Heroku-ready with Flask, PostgreSQL, Celery, Redis, and Prometheus/Sentry monitoring.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AiProphet13/hybrid-field-mapper.git
